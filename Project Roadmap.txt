  1. Hedge Trade SL/TP for `SynPropEA2.mq5`:  
      Confirmed:   `SynPropEA2.mq5` (Slave) will mirror SL/TP modifications from `SynPropEA1.mq5` (Master).
      Implementation:   The `COMMON_FILE` commands `OPEN_LONG`, `OPEN_SHORT`, and `MODIFY_SLTP` will include the SL and TP price levels. `SynPropEA2.mq5` will use these to set or modify the SL/TP on its corresponding hedge trades.

  2. Dynamic "Live Bal" and Dashboard Structure:  
      Confirmed:   "Live Bal" should be dynamic.
      Implementation for Dynamic Live Account Info:  
        `SynPropEA2.mq5` will write its current Account Balance, Equity, and perhaps Daily PnL to the `EA2_Status.txt` file on each tick or a regular short interval (e.g., every few seconds).
        `SynPropEA1.mq5` will read `EA2_Status.txt` on each tick to update its dashboard fields related to the live account (e.g., "Live Bal," "Profit on Real" for Cost Recovery).
      Manual Inputs for `SynPropEA1.mq5`:  
        Cost of Challenge (`challengeC` from your guide)
        Number of Stages (e.g., 1 or 2)
        Target Profit for current stage (`stageTgt`)
        Max Account Drawdown Limit (`maxDD`)
        Daily Drawdown Limit (You mentioned "daily DD" - I'll assume this is a monetary value or percentage).
      Dashboard Development:  
        The main dashboard for `SynPropEA1.mq5` will be developed in a separate `.mqh` include file for better code organization. This dashboard will be displayed on the chart where `SynPropEA1.mq5` is running.
        `SynPropEA2.mq5` will have a mini-dashboard displaying:
            Connection Status (to Master EA / File System)
            Its own Daily PnL

  3. Bleed Rule Removal:  
      Confirmed:   The Bleed rule, its logic, and the "Bleed" checkmark on the dashboard are completely removed.

  Dashboard Content - `SynPropEA1.mq5` (Main Dashboard in `.mqh`):
